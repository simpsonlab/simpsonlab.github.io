The Simpson Lab has been a regular contributor to the analysis of COVID-19 
as part of [CanCOGeN](https://genomecanada.ca/challenge-areas/cancogen).  
Our work on [ncov-tools](https://github.com/jts/ncov-tools), an analysis 
pipeline used in determining quality metrics for SARS-CoV-2 genomes, 
has provided labs with the tools needed to assess their samples.  Among this 
work, a collaboration with Ramzi Fattouh's lab at 
[Unity Health Toronto](https://unityhealth.to) has uncovered mutations in the 
nucleocapsid (N) gene resulting in issues with PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 
across Canada.  The details of this study can be found in a recent publication 
which outlines the methods used and the implications of potential genomic 
"blind spots".
